# Tray/Background Process Pattern for Display Control+

- Main process: tray app (shows icon, handles user interaction, launches overlays/screensavers as subprocesses)
- Background: overlays/screensavers run as separate processes (multiprocessing or subprocess)
- Use robust error handling and logging in both
- On 'Quit' from tray, terminate all child/background processes cleanly
- Use pystray for tray icon (see tray_icon_example.py)
- Use the .ico for all branding
